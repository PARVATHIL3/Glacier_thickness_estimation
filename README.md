# Steps to follow

**Step 1: Prepare Input Data**

1.	Download Required Data:
   
  •	RGI Version 7 glacier boundary and flowlines shapefiles for the study region.
  •	Velocity raster from Milan et al. for the same region (or estimate using Cosi Corr tool in ENVI).
  •	ASTER DEM tiles covering the study area.
  
2.	Organize Files into Folders:
   
  •	Create a main working directory (e.g., G:\glacier_project).
  •	Inside this folder, place:
    1.	RGI glacier boundaries and flowlines.
    2.	Velocity raster.
    3.	A subfolder named dem_tiles containing all your DEM tiles.

**Step 2: Run “All_inputs_automate_reproj” Code**

3.	Open the script All_inputs_automate_reproj.py in the ArcPy Python window (ArcGIS 10.1).
4.	Update file paths in the script:
    •	Path to your velocity raster, flowline shapefile, DEM tiles folder, and output folder.
5.	Run the script.
    •	This script will reproject and prepare all input layers and generate intermediate folders/outputs.

**Step 3: Handle Surging Glaciers (If Applicable)**

6.	If your study region contains surging glaciers, proceed as follows:
  •	Open surge vel.py in ArcPy.
  •	Provide paths to the velocity raster and the corresponding flowline shapefile.
  •	Run the script to average velocity along the flowlines.
7.	Next, run All_inputs_automate_reproj.py using the surging glacier inputs to prepare them for thickness estimation.

**Step 4: Estimate Glacier Thickness**

8.	Open the script code_workspace_and_thickness.py in ArcPy.
9.	Update file paths:
  •	Point to the inputs generated by the previous steps.
  •	Specify the output directory where you want the thickness rasters to be saved.
10.	Run the script to execute the thickness estimation algorithm.

**Step 5: Calculate Glacier Volume**

11.	Open the script code_to_get_sum.py in ArcPy.
12.	Provide the file paths:
  •	Path to the thickness rasters generated in the previous step.
  •	Specify the output path for the CSV file.
13.	Run the script.
  •	A CSV will be generated containing:
    1.	Workspace name
    2.	Sum of cell depths (ice thickness in meters)

**Step 6: Derive Total Water Storage**

14.	Multiply the total cell depth (from the CSV) by the pixel area to compute volume.
15.	Multiply this volume by the density of ice (∼900 kg/m³) to estimate the total mass of stored glacier ice in the study region.

**Notes**

  •	All scripts are designed for ArcGIS 10.1 using the ArcPy library.
  •	Ensure all input paths use double backslashes to avoid path errors.
